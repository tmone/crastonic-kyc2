# ShuftiPro Android Integration Fix

This document explains the implementation details for fixing the ShuftiPro SDK integration on Android.

## Problem Overview

The ShuftiPro SDK integration was causing the app to crash when initiating verification on Android due to:

1. **Data Binding Issues**: The ShuftiPro SDK uses data binding that was failing during activity initialization.
2. **Activity Lifecycle Problems**: The SDK activities weren't properly managed in the activity lifecycle.
3. **Missing Initialization**: The SDK wasn't being properly initialized at application startup.

## Solution Approach

Rather than continuing to use the default implementation from node_modules, we've created our own custom implementation that avoids the binding issues and properly manages the activity lifecycle.

### Files Created

1. **ShuftiProModule.java**: A custom React Native module that handles the ShuftiPro integration
2. **ShuftiProPackage.java**: A package class to register our custom module with React Native

### Changes Made

1. **Module Implementation**:
   - Created a custom module that uses an intent-based approach instead of binding
   - Implemented proper activity result handling with request codes
   - Added robust error handling with detailed logging

2. **Activity Lifecycle Management**:
   - Added an ActivityEventListener to handle activity results
   - Properly managed pending callbacks to prevent leaks
   - Added safeguards against multiple callback invocations

3. **SDK Initialization**:
   - Added early initialization of the SDK in MainApplication.kt
   - Added proper error handling for initialization failures

4. **Android Manifest**:
   - Already had the proper activity declarations
   - Made sure all required permissions are included

## How It Works

The new implementation uses a different approach to launch the ShuftiPro verification:

1. Instead of using the direct SDK method with binding, we start the activity using an Intent
2. We pass the verification parameters as extras in the Intent
3. We register an activity result listener to capture the verification result
4. We handle the result in the onActivityResult method

This approach avoids the binding issues that were causing crashes while still providing the same functionality.

## Comparison with Previous Approach

| Previous Approach | New Approach |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Used SDK method directly | Uses Intent to start activity |
| Relied on data binding | Avoids data binding issues |
| Crashed due to binding issues | Robust error handling |
| No activity result handling | Proper activity result handling |

## Testing

To test this solution:

1. Build and run the app on Android
2. Navigate to the KYC screen
3. Click "Start Verification"
4. The ShuftiPro verification should launch without crashing

## Future Improvements

1. Add more detailed error reporting
2. Enhance result handling with more metadata
3. Add support for additional ShuftiPro features
4. Implement better timeout handling
5. Add support for cancellation
