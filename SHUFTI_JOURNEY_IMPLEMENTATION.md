# ShuftiPro Journey Implementation

## Overview

This implementation uses ShuftiPro's Journey-based verification flow, which is a more streamlined approach compared to the basic SDK. Instead of managing the verification process directly within the app, we use a dedicated journey URL that ShuftiPro provides.

The current journey URL being used is:
```
https://app.shuftipro.com/verification/journey/fgecdahM1749419683
```

## Key Components

### 1. ShuftiProJourneyView

The `ShuftiProJourneyView` component is a WebView-based implementation that:

- Loads the ShuftiPro journey URL in a secure WebView
- Handles communication between the app and the ShuftiPro journey page
- Captures verification events and outcomes
- Provides a consistent UI across platforms
- Handles error states and cancellation

### 2. KYC Screen Integration

The KYC screen has been updated to:

- Use the journey-based approach instead of the SDK
- Manage verification state (idle, loading, in_progress, completed, failed)
- Show the verification in a modal when requested
- Handle verification completion and errors

## How It Works

1. **Starting Verification**:
   - User taps "Start Verification" on the KYC screen
   - App shows loading state and prepares the verification
   - ShuftiProJourneyView is displayed in a modal

2. **Verification Process**:
   - The WebView loads the ShuftiPro journey URL
   - User completes verification steps within the WebView
   - JavaScript injection captures events from the ShuftiPro journey

3. **Completion Handling**:
   - On successful verification, the app receives a success event
   - On verification failure, the app receives a declined event
   - If the user cancels, the app receives a cancellation event
   - Any errors during the process are captured and handled

## Advantages of the Journey Approach

1. **Simplicity**: No need to manage the complex verification flow within the app
2. **Reliability**: Less prone to crashes and compatibility issues
3. **Updates**: ShuftiPro can update the verification flow without app changes
4. **Consistency**: Same verification experience across platforms
5. **Compliance**: Meets all regulatory requirements for KYC verification

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

- Network errors are caught and reported
- Timeouts are implemented to prevent stuck verifications
- User cancellation is handled gracefully
- Verification failures are reported back to the app

## Testing

To test this implementation:

1. Run the app on a device or simulator
2. Navigate to the KYC screen
3. Tap "Start Verification"
4. Complete the verification process in the WebView
5. Observe the app handling the verification result

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check the journey URL is valid and accessible
- Ensure the WebView is properly configured with JavaScript enabled
- Verify the injected JavaScript is capturing ShuftiPro events
- Check the console logs for errors from the WebView
